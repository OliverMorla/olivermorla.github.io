                        My name is Oliver Maldonado, and I'm an aspiring software developer. As a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring 
                        in computer information systems at NYC City College of Technology, I believe I have the necessary academic and research 
                        background to be a competent contributor to your team. Moreover, designing and customizing software, analyzing user needs 
                        to develop software solutions, and creating technical specifications and test plans can directly complement my career.
                        Currently, I work as a front desk associate at Crunch Fitness, where I simultaneously take on tasks relevant to software 
                        development and troubleshooting. For example, re-installing drivers and swapping hard disks were a few of the resolutions 
                        that I decided to employ while on duty. Additionally, recovering user accounts and creating back-up files are strategies 
                        I employ for troubleshooting during my shift. Through my prior experience, I’ve learned how to manage my work in a collaborative 
                        environment. Furthermore, I understand the intricacies of computer development work. I can maintain focus on my individual tasks, 
                        with full knowledge of how they contribute to the overall research goals, no matter how mundane and repetitive my tasks are. I am 
                        confident in my capabilities for this position because I am a creative thinker and a proactive employee, and I am strongly motivated 
                        to fulfill the user’s needs. If software developer assignments run late into the evening, this will not be an issue for me because 
                        I am aware from my previous experience that the tasks can be extensive, both in time and activity. A Software Engineer is responsible 
                        for more than simply programming. It's an opportunity to assist others. Problem solving was a talent I lacked, which finally led 
                        to my failure. That is why pursuing a career as a software developer was so vital to me. I wanted to share the message of simplicity 
                        and provide solutions for a wide range of audiences. Having this role provides engineers like me the ability to influence others.
                        My purpose is to give people's lives with applications that might assist them with day-to-day responsibilities. 
                        Software Development is a growing vocation, which means that new opportunities for this role arise on a daily basis. 
                        Also, one of the benefits of this work is the amount of money you make. Software Engineering is a rewarding profession.
